## 🧠 Inspiration

Toronto is one of the most diverse and vibrant cities in the world... but it can also be one of the loneliest. Over half of Canadians report feeling lonely. At hackathons and local events, we saw the same thing: people want to connect — but starting a conversation can be awkward.

That’s why we built **gotcha!** — a location-aware social app inspired by the fun of Pokémon Go. Instead of catching creatures, you “catch” real people nearby to spark meaningful conversations. Through shared goals and friendly challenges, **gotcha!** turns strangers into teammates — and maybe even friends.

## 🚀 What It Does

**gotcha!** is a web-based app that:

- Detects nearby users using geolocation
- Lets one user “catch” another with a single tap
- Sends an SMS to the person caught, including:
  - A link to the catcher’s profile
  - Icebreakers based on shared interests
- Encourages face-to-face connection in real life

## 🔮 What’s Next

- ✅ Add **consent toggles** and **invisible mode** so users can opt out anytime  
- ✅ Let users set more detailed preferences (age, pronouns, etc.)  
- ✅ Expand **interest tagging** for deeper matching  
- 🚀 Launch *gotcha!* at real events, schools, and hackathons
